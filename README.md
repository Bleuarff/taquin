I stumbled upon this puzzle that triggered my curiosity. So here's a site that will endlessy try to solve it, each time in less moves than before. Let's see what results it can achieve. Current best at time of writing (and I doubt I'll keep this updated) is 170 moves to solve the puzzle.


TODO:
- Replay: play the best-known sequence at human-legible speed.
- Replay: box shadow on pieces, with dynamic z-index to handle perspective
- Replay: use css transform for piece moves.
