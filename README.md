# Taquin

Résolveur d'un casse-tête.

TODO:
- UI to adjust position, change pieces
- Replay mode: UI to show solving sequence only

- close page btn

Cell mapping: quick way to determine free cells ? store indexes and send only that. solve computes index of coordinates and check if result is in a list.

- [Replay mode] box shadow on pieces, with dynamic z-index to handle perspective
